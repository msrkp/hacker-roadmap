# Becoming a Hacker: A Guide for Computer Newbies -- Roadmap

The following will be a guide for anyone who is interested to get started in hacking or infosec. All the below content is based on the assumption that the reader don't know anything about computer/hacking.

"I can only show you the door. You're the one that has to walk through it." - Morpheus, The Matrix. I'm giving you the map, but you've got to steer the journey. Success depends on your effort and choices.


# Target Audience
1. **PERSISTENT Learner**: In my opinion, this is the only quality needed to learn anything. You need to be a continuous learner, however the learning curve for the first one or two years will be very steep. If you can't ride these initial hard years and be persistent, sadly chances of being successful are very less.
2. **Degree**: You don't need any kind of degree. If you can read that is good enough. I don't think not knowing English very well would be any problem, there are very good translators which can help.
3. **Resources**: Anyone with basic configuration laptop and Internet.

# Inspiration

It is important to realize that each and every one of us has different IQ levels. One might learn or solve problems quickly, while on the other hand, you might take a full day to solve the same problem. In the end, what counts is solving the problem, which is nothing but the quality of a persistent learner. However, it is very important to realize your potential; IQ is not a one-dimensional measure. Some might be good in maths, others in entrepreneurship, and others in coding. Similarly, the infosec field has various areas one can be good at. One who is good at math can choose cryptography, one can choose reverse engineering, and one can choose web exploitation.

Let us consider my case on why to choose web exploitation as the primary field. I used to solve all kinds of CTF challenges like cryptography, pwn, and web. The basic crypto problems are no-brainer to me, but when trying to solve problems that involve a lot of math and visualization like elliptical curve cryptography, I used to struggle a lot. You should note that it is not that I can't solve it with persistence; I just take a lot of time to solve, and my cryptography teammate used to solve very easily. So, I realized my IQ is not as good as the cryptography and reverse engineering CTF mates, so I explored binary exploitation and web exploitation.

Bottom line: Figure out what you're good at, play to your strengths, and own your game.


# What is hacking?

Opening a beer bottle using your teeth is an unusual or unintended way to solve the problem of opening the beer bottle. In hindi there is a word for this *Jugaad*, which means coming up with clever and quick solutions using whatever you have around to solve a problem. Similarly in computer science hacking, someone who has a deep understanding of computer systems and networks and is able to use this knowledge to make software or hardware to work in unexpected ways either for problem solving, or achieving specific goals.

For example, increasing likes or views in instagram post is a hack. Asking the question needs curiosity, to confirm if it is possible at all needs technical understanding and knowledge of how an web application works. Once you have technical understanding, exploring various way to increase likes needs creativity. The curiosity and creativity can be acquired through experience. To acquire technical understanding we need to know about computers, and network system. I will share few resources where you can acquire this below.

# Computer Science Degree?

You can't be a car mechanic without knowing how the car actually works. But have you wondered the mechanics in our towns/villages know the physics of how an internal combustion engine works? I don't think so, they just know enough to fix. Unlike medical field, you can go wrong as many times as you want until you fix it by taking help from other mechanics and exploration. A curious mechanic might explore ways to make it more efficient, so he starts learning about physics and mechanics of a combustion engine. Until at this point, he don't need to know the science. He can just learn about whenever there is need, this is called learning by doing. 

And escepicially the computer science field is so wonderful, anyone can be good at it because every resource you ever need is there online. So here are few thing you should search on google and read online, if you don't know anything about computer. Just search, read and watch. First time you watch or read these, you might not understand a bit. But it is fine, you will slowly but surely understand, as I said there is a steep learning curve initially. 

- What is a computer?
- What is an operating system?
- How does the internet work, and what are common browsers and search engines?
- What is coding or programming?

If you don't understand or know about a concept you are reading. Search and read about it, it is exhausting recursion(search-read-search-read-search) but after some time the amount of searches you do will reduce.


# Various fields of hacking
There are different areas in information security:

Hardware Hacking: Manipulating or exploiting the physical components of a hardware for unauthorized access/actions. Ex: Side-channel attacks, RFID hacking, JTAG exploitation

Binary Exploitation: Finding flaws in Binary Files such as OS, Browsers, and Native Applications 

Reverse Engineering: Converting the Machine code / Assembly back to human readable code.

Web Exploitation: Exploiting Web Apps.

Cryptography: Cryptography involves lot of maths; breaking ciphers, algorithms, and much more. 

Forensics: This involves the investigation of computer systems after a hack.

Blockchain Security: Finding flaws in blockchain implementations, dApps. So much money hereâ€¦.
